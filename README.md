# 🌐 Morph: AI Safety Education for Everyone  
**Making AI safety relatable, actionable, and inclusive—no matter your background.**

## 🚨 The Problem  
AI safety education is often **too technical**, **culturally generic**, and **disconnected from real-world action**. Parents, policymakers, and global learners need tools that bridge theory to practice—without jargon or Western bias.

## 🌟 What is Morph?  
Morph is a **playful, culturally adaptive platform** that complements BlueDot’s AI safety curriculum with:  

### Key Features  
1. **Localized Learning**  
   - 🌏 AI-driven metaphors (e.g., “AI bias → monsoon risks”) make risks relatable.  
   - 🇲🇾/🇳🇬/🇪🇺 Region-specific policy examples (healthcare, education).  

2. **Ecosystem Mapper**  
   - 🗺️ Roadmap.sh-style visualization of BlueDot’s curriculum + actionable tools (e.g., Policy Brief Drafter).  
   - 🔍 Explore connections between courses, frameworks, and real-world projects.  

3. **Policy Simulations**  
   - 🎮 Interactive scenarios (e.g., “Regulate facial recognition in schools”) with instant feedback.  
   - 📊 Causal inference models evaluate trade-offs (privacy vs. innovation).  

4. **AI Safety Monitor (Chrome Extension)**  
   - 🛠️ Real-time alerts for risky AI interactions (e.g., “This app collects excessive data”).  
   - 🧒 Parent-friendly explainers (e.g., “Why TikTok’s algorithm shows extreme content”).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend**: React.js + Pastel Jellyfish-themed UI (Figma).  
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python (Bottle.py), Neo4j.  
- **AI Tools**: Hugging Face Transformers, Replit AI Agent.  
- **Deployment**: Fully hosted on Replit 🚀.
