#### Are you ready for what's coming?

Just five years ago, AI struggled to form coherent sentences. Today, millions rely on ChatGPT daily. Tomorrow? We might be sharing our world with systems that outthink us in nearly every domain.

AI can already create stunning art, write complex code, and guide robots through physical tasks. Companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in a race to build even more powerful systems. And top AI researchers believe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) could arrive within the next 2-5 years.

The question isn't just "What will AI be able to do?" but "How will it transform our lives, our work, and our society?"

Will it unlock unprecedented scientific breakthroughs and economic prosperity? Or will it amplify humanity's worst tendencies and create new existential risks?

This course takes you beyond the headlines to understand what's really happening in AI, where it's headed, and why it matters to you—no matter who you are or what you do.

You don't need any technical background to take this course. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a concerned citizen, or simply curious about where AI is headed, this course will equip you with the understanding needed to navigate the technological transformation that's reshaping our world.

#### What you'll discover

From AI's core mechanisms to its societal implications, we'll explore the following topics and tackle these associated questions:

- **The Expanding Frontier of AI Capabilities** _How do current AI systems like ChatGPT actually work, and how have they become so powerful in just a few years?_

- **From Tools to Agents** _What's the difference between AI as a helpful tool and AI as an autonomous agent—and why does this distinction matter?_

- **AGI on the Horizon** _What exactly is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), how close are we to achieving it, and why do even skeptics think it may be coming soon?_

- **Immense Benefits** _Could advanced AI accelerate scientific breakthroughs, drive economic prosperity, and solve some of humanity's toughest challenges?_

- **Unprecedented Risks** _What critical dangers must we confront—from misuse to losing control over increasingly autonomous systems?_

- **Shaping the Future** _What choices must we make—individually and collectively—to ensure AI benefits humanity rather than threatens it?_


Each unit combines frameworks with real-world examples, interactive demonstrations, and reflection exercises that will help you make sense of AI’s future.

Join us as we explore the most consequential technological development of our time—and consider what role each of us might play in ensuring AI's development benefits humanity.

Think about where AI capabilities were 5 years ago, and where they are today. What do you think AI will and won’t be able to do in 5 years’ time?

In your own words, how would you describe the difference between a ‘tool’ and an ‘agent’? Give one example of each

Which of these tasks would most clearly demonstrate capabilities beyond current AI systems?

A technology company has developed a new AI system. Which capability would most strongly suggest this system is an AGI?

Given the new information above, how does this affect your previous predictions of what you think AI will and won’t be able to do in 5 years’ time?

Which of your skills or knowledge might become more or less valuable in a world with AGI?

**Personal Impact**: Think of a specific challenge in your life or a problem you care about (healthcare costs, climate change, education access). How might advanced AI help solve this particular issue?

**Equal Access**: If AI creates tremendous new wealth and opportunities, how do you think this wealth and access to these opportunities might be distributed?

Who is best positioned to guide AI positively (e.g. government, AI company, or others)? If you had power there, what's one thing you'd do to help AGI develop positively, and why?

What can you do right now to prepare yourself and others for a future with AGI? When future generations ask what role you played during its rise, what do you hope you'll be able to tell them about your choices and actions?
