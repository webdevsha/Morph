I've created comprehensive wireframes for the Morph AI safety education platform based on our user flow diagram; Morph AI Safety Education platform uses Qwen API/ Deepseek API. These wireframes cover key screens that reflect the platform's core features and user journeys:
1. Welcome/ Login Screen
Persona selection (Learner, Parent, Policymaker) - but make it as a question (eg “Why do we need AI safety?” or “I am not sure policymaker could benefit from AI safety.” or “Would AI safe for my family?”)
Login functionality (but later when they’ve been using for 3 pages, then you prompt registration or when they wanna use more exclusive pages eg Ecosystem Mapper or Tools - they can view and test but limited)
Brand identity placement - Morph uses pastel color from Spongebob’s Jellyfish
Put a Statistics or News on how AI Safety Public Education is Important
Shortcut: they can paste BlueDot Course URL and Morph AI can read and adjust for the ecosystem tools we have
2. Non-UK/US Learner Dashboard
Region and language toggles for localization - language toggles to be included later
Culturally adapted content preview according to the region they select
Interactive simulation component
Progress tracking and learning path sidebar -> that will bring them to Ecosystem Mapper
Peer-mentor matching - based on LinkedIn tagged with BlueDot Course Attendance (peer could mean alumni from current batch, to balance the busy AI safety experts)
3. Ecosystem Mapper (Roadmap.sh style)
Timeline/ Topic view toggle 
Visual progression path (Prompted with “I am currently an X” and the pathway would show possible pathways they can do full time or part time)
Detailed view of the a selected Career stage
Tool integration (Project Assistant)
Skill progression tracking
Resources library
4. Ecosystem Tool eg Policy Drafter tool or Project Assistant or Writing Assistant
These tools are in Ecosystem to support the learner wholly - they are assessed by not lengthy exams but for each Course Unit, they could be asked to apply into various types of pedagogical instruments: these are Mini-Assessments and Nudges
Template-based policy creation interface or Projects and Writings according to BlueDot curriculum
Fill-in-the-blank form fields for these frameworks
Template library sidebar (from the past alumnus)
Save and export functionality
5. Dashboard Overview Screen
Ecosystem (could be quirky but still minimalist) interface to see where we are in the AI safety journey
Skills as strengths overview (based on their current and past skills & newly gained skills from the BlueDot their learning)
Nudges to apply their new skills
